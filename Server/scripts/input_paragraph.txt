I got this for less than k with discounts during the sale, an incredible deal for a Tier-1 brand like DELL in that price rangeThe pre-installed OS was slow and buggy, but after performing a clean installation of Windows, it has been working flawlesslyOverall, it's a well-balanced system with a stunning 120 Hz IPS displayThe only downside is the drive used in thisDELL has opted for a Gen 4 QLC drive instead of a Gen 3 TLC drive, which may have a shorter lifespan.
